# City Street Explorer Service
This repo contains Java parsers for the OpenStreetMap API. The project is presented as an API that has unfortunately not been deployed yet. The main functionality is parsing data received by the Overpass API to a graph. A custom Graph implementation is provided here as well to fit the problem requirements. Some routing algorithms (conventional and unconventional) have been provided as well with adapters that work with MapBox. 
This project provides implementations that have been made from scratch, and it has not undergone enough testing to be used on a live production system. 

More complex routing algorithm have been implemented in python. Please refer to repo main page.
